/**
 * LeetCode Problem: Fibonacci Number (LeetCode 509)
 *
 * Problem Description:
 * The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n), form a sequence such that
 * each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
 * Time Complexity: O(2^n) - exponential due to recursive calls
 * Space Complexity: O(n) - recursion stack depth
